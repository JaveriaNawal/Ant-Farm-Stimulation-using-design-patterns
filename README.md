# Ant-Farm-Stimulation-using-design-patterns
The Ant-Farm simulation in C++ uses design patterns to model the behavior of ants in a virtual environment. It applies patterns like the Strategy pattern to define ant movement algorithms, the Observer pattern for communication between ants, and the Factory pattern to create different types of ants, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
